1. describing your idea, 

    The objective of this assignment collect Google Trends daily and weekly data with the 
    keyword ‘bitcoin’ since 2015-01-01 and save results in csv or json file.
    
    This will be done by using the pytrends library and looping for each half year.


2. the amount of time you spent on finishing the program code (or pseudo code), 

    The program took about 3-4 hours to complete reaserach and development included.

3. the different ways you have tried to approach the TECH ASSESSMENT, 
    
    I originally tried to get all the daily information in one query but the API 
    wouldn't let me have every single day. thats when I had to get every half year 
    so that  i could have everyday and append it to the DataFrame and eventually sent to CSV

4. the reasons of settling on the current approach, and finally, 

    the current approach allows for the infomration for every single date to be obtained between
    Jan 01 2015 to Spet 18 2022. Whereas, the other approach skipped dates which was not good. 

5. how to execute your program.
    For DAILY results run: daily.py
    For WEEKLY results run: weekly.py (upto 2015-06-14 for time sake)
